## Capture notes

- Use real pool data with non-sensitive names where possible.
- Keep browser zoom at `100%`.
- Prefer a desktop viewport that shows all 3 panes.
- Verify dark-theme contrast remains readable.

## Next wiring steps

1. Add a screenshot gallery section in `README.md` referencing the five files
   above.
2. Mark Milestone `R.4` complete in `PLAN.md` when README wiring is done.
